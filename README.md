### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alex, and I mainly use GitHub to collaborate on university group projects and to develop a ticket analysis program at my current job.

Right now, I'm learning React and Node.js to turn the software I build into a web-friendly application.

My reserach interests lie in artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction.

In my free time, I love to learn languages (currently working on German).
